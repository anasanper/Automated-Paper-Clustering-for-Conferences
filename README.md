# Automated Paper Clustering for Conferences

This repository contains code and documents related to undergraduate thesis project titled "Automated Paper Clustering for Conferences: A Natural Language Processing Approach".

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to use natural language processing and machine learning techniques to cluster conference papers based on thematic similarity. Different clustering algorithms are explored, and an approach based on vector representation of texts using term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) scheme is applied. Furthermore, the obtained results, potential limitations, and future research directions are discussed.

## Repository Structure

- `code/`: Contains script files, including TextAnalysis_Functions.ipynb and Text_Clustering_System.ipynb.
- Automated_Paper_Clustering_for_Conference: PDF of the thesis.

## Using the Code

- Text_Clustering_System.ipynb contains the system divided into functions that, when executed the entire notebook, cluster papers extracted from PDFs based on their similarity.
- TextAnalysis_Functions.ipynb contains useful functions for training the model.
